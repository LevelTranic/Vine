## What is Vine?
<p>Vine is a general multithreaded Minecraft server that is not specifically designed for one type of gameplay, as that would just cause more trouble. So, just do what you need to do and focus on optimizations, fixes, and features that donâ€™t affect the game mechanics.</p>
<p>Vine was named after a friend of mine, which of course was nothing special, just because I didn't know what to name it.</p>
<br />

## Feature
- Sub-regional multi-threading introduced by ShreddedPaper can better withstand a large number of dense players.
- Builtin and the latest Kotlin dependency library.
- Various performance optimization.
- Support virtual threads
- Implement secure seeds to avoid cracking.
- Some interesting features, of course they are all turned off by default.
- Implemented SectorFile and Linear region formats to save a lot of storage space.
- Expanded options allow restoring more vanilla abilities.
- And some fixes from various places.
