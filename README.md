> (for Folia, there is no GlobalRegion scheduling) to develop plugins.
> 
> ShreddedPaper/Vine is completely different from Folia. Players' 
> operations will still have a certain impact on other players,

    <h2>What is Vine?</h2>
    <p>Vine is a general multithreaded Minecraft server that is not specifically designed for one type of gameplay, as that would just cause more trouble. So, just do what you need to do and focus on optimizations, fixes, and features that donâ€™t affect the game mechanics.</p>
    <p>Vine was named after a friend of mine, which of course was nothing special, just because I didn't know what to name it.</p>

    <h2>Feature</h2>
    <li>Sub-regional multi-threading introduced by ShreddedPaper can better withstand a large number of dense players.</li>
    <li>Implement secure seeds to avoid cracking.</li>
    <li>Expanded options allow restoring more vanilla abilities.</li>
    <li>And some fixes from various places.</li>
    <br />
</div>

<div align=center>
    <h2>Todo</h2>
    <li>Implement Linear region format (Too much work, don't think about it for now.)</li>
    <li>Implement other region formats, such as Cesium (The same reason as Linear. This is the first time I have gone to such a deep place, and I need to continue to analyze it.)</li>
    <li>Optional vanilla implementation (There are already some, do I need to remove this one...?)</li>
    <li>More mods implement.....</li>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>Our Discord server is still under construction and I don't have that much time to maintain it all. For now, I recommend filing issues on Github as much as possible.</p>
